      <div class="reach-div">
        At DMart, we believe in corporate social responsibility and have always
        been committed to contributing to the communities in which we operate.
        While being focused on sustained economic performance, we are also
        acutely aware of the necessity and importance of social stewardship.
        Towards this end, we seek to enrich the lives of the future generation –
        the children of our country – through our efforts to create better
        environments and infrastructure in public schools in select wards of
        Mumbai city.

      <div class="reach-div">
        We have a school excellence program through which we aim to develop
        infrastructure , improve educational facilities and work towards
        sustainable progress in public schools in selected wards of Mumbai . We
        work with these schools and seek to implement better teaching facilities
        (such as libraries & science labs) and develop infrastructure (such as
        toilets and playgrounds) by working with partner organisations. We hope
        to improve the quality of education and provide children with better
        education and development opportunities

        Our constant focus on educating the citizens of tomorrow has seen strong
        progress in the current year. In FY 2018-19, we have aided more than
        95,000 students and helped them in their goal of educating themselves
        for a better tomorrow. Our intent is to continue working towards
        foundational learning among the students leading to basic grade specific
        student learning outcomes
